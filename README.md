# Report on "Identifiability of bivariate causal structures"
* Demonstrated that eruption time of Old Faithful Geyser has a causal effect on the waiting time of the consecutive eruption using causal
models [LiNGAM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2333/bhmk.41.65) and [bi-variate Additive Noise Models (ANM)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2981780.2981866) implemented in R.
* Studied causal inference with emphasis placed on bi-variate structural equation models by following the book ["Elements of Causal Inference"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037310/elements-of-causal-inference/) by Jonas Peters et al.
* Old Faithful Geyser Data is available in base-R. The dataset can be accessed using `data("faithful")`.
