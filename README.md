* Demonstrated that eruption time of Old Faithful Geyser has a causal effect on the waiting time of the consecutive eruption using causal
models LiNGAM and bi-variate ANM implemented in R.
* Studied causal inference with emphasis placed on bi-variate structural equation models by following the book by Jonas Peters et al.
